## Introduction
The River Ouse is a river in the north of the UK. It flows 84km in total through the city of York and the
towns of Selby and Goole before joining the River Trent to form the Humber Estuary on the east coast of
the UK. The River Aire, Don, Wharfe and Foss are all tributaries which flow into the River Ouse[1].
York is a historical walled city with a population of approximately 200,000 people , located at the confluence
of the River Ouse and the River Foss[2].York has a history of extreme flooding and was recently devastated
by the 2015 Boxing day floods where one of the city’s major flood defences (the Foss Barrier)experienced
an electrical problem and failed[3].

There are 17 river monitoring stations located on the River Ouse, 6 of which are located in the York
area.[4,5]. The Viking Recorder and Foss Barrier monitoring stations are located in central York whilst
the Clifton Ings and Skelton monitoring stations are located within a 5 mile radius of the city centre.
The Skelton monitoring station (approximately 4 miles southwest from the city centre) records both stage
and discharge whilst the Viking Recorder, Foss Barrier and Clifton Ings stations only record stage. No
rating change reports are available for the Viking Recorder and Foss Barrier Stations because hydrologists
deem the relationship between stage and flow to be too unreliable at these locations.

## Flood Mitigation

In November 2016, the Evironmental Agency Released a 13 page document titled "How we're reducing the risk of flooding in York" in response to the December 2015 floods. Click here to access:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568910/EA_York_Flood_Action_Plan__FINAL.pdf 

The document highlighted 10 communities at risk and made suggestions for flood mitigation including building and raising embankments, flood walls, land, creating storage areas and increasing the pump capacity of pump stations.

## Project Progress
* Report transferred into LaTex (see PDF). Started doing equations/tables yet have not input my graphs.
* Updated my To-Do-List
* Quadrant plot complete for Skelton 2015. hT to be determined still. Polynomial fitting function of order 2 used as a make-shift rating curve. Noticed some calibration measurements in the comments section of my raw data so want to include them and maybe give them double weighting to my polynomial fitting function. 
* York's flood mitigation plan is active, but has not been fully analysed. Rescheduled to meet with EA this Friday. Problems in my chemistry experiments meant that the previous meeting had to be postponed. I am currenly mapping the locations of montioring stations, the flood cells, catchment areas and the mitigation they propose. In the 5 year plan,
